This plugin configures `JavaCompile` tasks to use the [Major Mutation Framework](https://mutation-testing.org) for mutation analysis.

## Download

Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    // Checker Framework pluggable type-checking
    id 'org.mutationtesting' version '0.0.1'
}

apply plugin: 'org.mutationtesting'
```

The `org.mutationtesting` plugin modifies existing Java compilation tasks. You
should apply it *after* whatever plugins introduce your Java compilation tasks
(usually the `java` or `java-library` plugin for non-Android builds).


## Java 9+ compatibility

Major doesn't currently build on Java 9+. This is
[an issue][https://github.com/rjust/major/issues/20] in the current Major
repository.


## Credits

thanks to Martin for all the help he provided while I adapted this plugin.
